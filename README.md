# Game_Jam_01
Epitech Game Jam Mars 2020
We were a group of 6 and we had 2 days to create a game. The theme was the street-art.

##How to play##
Go to the "build" folder and launch "Jam.exe"

Once the game is launched, you'll have 90 secondes (1min30) to score the highest score possible. You have to launch paints balls to replace
the "ugly" tag by the "nice" tag. You can deplace you character wtih 'q' and 'd' and shoot with left mouse button. The direction of the
proectile is defined by your cursor position

Have fun!
